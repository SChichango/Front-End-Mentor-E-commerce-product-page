## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
  -JavaScript

### Continued development

I want to focus more on Javascript, especially DOM manipulation. It was the area which took me the majority of the time to get it how I wanted it to be, and even after finnishing the project I feel like the code could've actually been less than what I wrote.

### Useful resources

- [Image Slider](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) - This helped me make the image slider for the page. It was a simple tutorial and I could implement it right away in my project
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me better understand flexbox and how I could use it to make my layout's appearence much closer to the images.
